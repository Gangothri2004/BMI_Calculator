BMI Calculator
This is a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator built using Python and Tkinter. BMI is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults.

Features:
Simple Interface: The calculator provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input their weight and height, and view their BMI.

BMI Calculation: The calculator computes BMI using the formula: BMI = weight(kg) / (height(m))^2.

BMI Classification: After calculating BMI, the calculator provides a classification based on the calculated BMI value. It indicates whether the user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

How to Use:
Enter your weight in kilograms (kg) in the provided input field.
Enter your height in meters (m) in the provided input field.
Click on the "Calculate BMI" button to compute your BMI.
The result will be displayed along with a classification indicating your weight status.
Technologies Used:
Python: The calculator is implemented using Python, a versatile and easy-to-learn programming language.
Tkinter: Tkinter is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for Python. It is used to create the graphical interface for the BMI calculator.
How to Run:
